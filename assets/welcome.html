Hello! I'm Alessandro, and I wanted to personally thank you for joining the
Nexto journey. To get things moving, I'll be adding you to our Google test group
today so you can dive into the platform. I've also sent a Slack invitation — I'd
love to have you there to keep the lines of communication open and easy.

My goal is to build this tool around you. If there's anything I can do to smooth
out the experience or if you have immediate feedback, I'm all ears. Cheers,
